### The Opportunity
There are a lot of smaller breeders, whom aren’t as “Savvy” with the modern internet. I’ve seen French bulldog puppies listed in craigslist ads and in weekly “used car magazines”, that were only distributed in a small rural communities (Seriously), by happenstance I was getting gas and noticed puppies listed next to a used pickup truck. 

### How I Responded 
Now I collect probably 100’s of these small farmer trader, auto trader, & craigslist classifieds listings daily. 
I drive to these small towns and meet with the breeders, whom in a lot of cases have one litter per year, or maybe even one litter every 5-10 years.  I meet with them, hear their stories and usually make an offer.

### How they will be defined at Ethical Frenchie
The puppies listed as “Partner Puppies” are sourced from the relationships that I’ve built on the road and networking.  
Any French Bulldog puppy listed as Partner Puppy is one that 	__**I did not breed myself**__ (I can’t keep up with the demand).

I check to ensure that the breeder is doing everything correctly and that there is no puppy mill involved.  Once you take home a partner puppy you are given the contact information of the breeder and their profile/bio if you have any questions.
__**Partner Puppies are covered by the same guarantee as our own puppies**__ This is a registered, licensed taxed business, naturally it is imperative to make sure our customers are protected __*(so that our company doesn't go bankrupt on poorly bred french bulldogs)*__  The documentation and health requirements for our Partner Puppies are the same as our own.

### What's in it for you?
The answer is short and easy, The value for you in a partner puppy is your time saved, searching several website listings, questioning the validity of the puppies you see online, going into questionably shady situations with people who appear to be doing things right.

I do all of that for you, because by the nature of this business and all of my time on the road, I've already qualified and vetted several breeders, their litters will be listed here.

Time = Saved

### Availability
Currently we have 1 Partner Puppy listed, with more to come. __-Signed James__ {{ site.time | date: '%m/%d/%y' }}
