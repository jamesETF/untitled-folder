## About Cesar

Cesar is our one and only boy, he’s what we called a “blue merle pied’ French bulldog. His unique coat and ocean blue eyes will catch everybody’s attention, but let’s not forget about his warm and friendly personality.
Cesar is a very laid back and chill little guy. He kinda had no choice, since he was born to a litter of dramatic female frenchies. Being the only boy, the only way to survive was to enter his zen place and ignore the drama. 
He would do great in any home, either a house or apartment, as long as he gets his snacks and lots of love.
