Meet Mila!

Mila is that rare little soul who seems born with good manners. She’s calm, observant, and carries herself with a quiet confidence that makes her a natural fit in any home. While her littermates tumble and dash about, Mila prefers to sit back and watch, choosing her moments to join in. When she does, she plays kindly and politely, then settles right back into a cozy nap at your side. With her soft lilac-and-tan coat and her easygoing nature, Mila feels less like a puppy you’re training and more like a gentle companion who’s been with you forever.
