Meet Winnie!

Winnie is **pure sunshine** wrapped in a chunky **Blue Fawn Merle** package. He's the first to waddle over with that signature Frenchie grin, tail wagging at full speed, ready to make your day brighter. There's nothing subtle about Winnie's love—he's all about belly rubs, snuggle sessions, and the occasional enthusiastic nose boop. Like his namesake, Winnie the Pooh, this little guy has a **heart as big as his appetite** and a sweet, easygoing nature that makes everyone fall in love instantly.

He's the puppy who greets the morning with a playful bounce, spends his afternoons chasing toys (or napping in the sunniest spot), and ends the day curled up in your lap like he belongs there. Winnie has that **rare gift of making every moment feel warmer and more joyful**—whether he's goofing around with his littermates or giving you those soulful eyes that say *"one more treat, please?"*

He's the perfect match for a family that wants a loyal, fun-loving companion with plenty of personality and an **endless supply of affection**.
