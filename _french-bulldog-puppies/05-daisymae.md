Meet Daisy Mae!

Daisy Mae is the pint-size spark plug of the litter—spunky, curious, and always first to see what’s happening in the next room. She’ll chase a squeaky toy with serious determination, then remember she’s a cuddle bug and back into your lap like a little reverse-parking pro. With other dogs, she’s an easy, thoughtful playmate: happy to wrestle, equally happy to match a calmer vibe. Around people, she does a cheerful little “happy hop” at mealtime and already offers a tidy **sit** for treats. Short version: she keeps the day lively and the couch warm.
