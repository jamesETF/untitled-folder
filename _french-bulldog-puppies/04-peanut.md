Meet Peanut!  

Peanut is our rambunctious, playful, and curious Isabella French Bulldog puppy. Always on the go, he’s the first one to grab a toy, chase a leaf in the yard, or nudge you for another round of tug-of-war. His adventurous personality makes him endlessly entertaining, but he also has a soft side — when the day winds down, he loves curling up and snoozing right by your side.  

What makes Peanut extra special is his **rare Isabella coat**. Isabella French Bulldogs are one of the rarest colorations in the breed, and Isabella Merle even more so. His striking light coat paired with sparkling blue eyes makes him a true standout.  

He’s 8 weeks old and ready to find his forever family. Peanut will grow into a compact, muscular Frenchie weighing around 20–25 lbs as an adult.
