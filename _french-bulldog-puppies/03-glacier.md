Meet Glacier!

Glacier is a showstopper—**tri merle** coat with **deep sky-blue eyes** that will *stay blue forever*. He’s the first to greet you, tail doing a happy wiggle, then he’s off to check on everyone else like the little hall monitor of the group. He’s passionate about people, gentle with smaller buddies, and has a gift for getting along with absolutely everyone. There’s no drama with this boy—just play bows, soft nose boops, and the occasional proud prance when he finds a new favorite toy.

He’s the perfect match for a family that wants a puppy with sparkle and sweetness: playful when you’re up for it, content to curl in your lap when the day winds down.
