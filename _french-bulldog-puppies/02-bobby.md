Meet Hey Arnold!

Arnold is the kind of puppy who makes you rethink everything you thought you knew about French Bulldogs. While the others in his litter were competing for attention over the Christmas season, Arnold was simply **patient, observant, and utterly unfazed**. One by one, his littermates found their families, and Arnold? He just settled in on the couch, kept us company through our Netflix marathons, and never complained once. Not a single howl, cry, or dramatic protest. Just a calm, knowing gaze that says, *"I'm good right here."*

There's something **wise beyond his weeks** about Arnold. He's the puppy who doesn't demand your attention he earns it through quiet loyalty and an easygoing temperament that makes him the perfect companion for any household. While other puppies might keep your neighbors up at night, Arnold is the type who'll just find a sunny spot, stretch out, and observe the world going by. He's **man's best friend** in the truest sense low-maintenance, adaptable, and always up for whatever the day brings, whether that's a walk through the neighborhood or just hanging out while you work from home.

In the beginning, Arnold had to compete with his siblings for food, so he developed a little protective streak nothing aggressive, just a *"hey, that's mine"* attitude. But as the boarding house cleared out and he became the solo pup, that melted away entirely. Now he's as relaxed as they come, perfectly content to share space, food, and affection without a fuss. Arnold's the kind of companion who fits seamlessly into your life, bringing a sense of calm and steadiness that's rare to find.
