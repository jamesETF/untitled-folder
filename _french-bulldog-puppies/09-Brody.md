## About Me

Introducing our charming Brody, a Lilac & Tan French Bulldog, and the celestial sibling of our enchanting Selena. Like the gallant knights of the past, Brody exudes nobility and charm with his striking coat and mesmerizing blue eyes. As a passionate and devoted breeder, it brings both joy and a touch of melancholy to present this little gentleman to his future forever family.

Our Brody, named in honor of the valiant heroes throughout history, carries himself with a quiet and noble demeanor. At just 6 weeks old, this reserved and somewhat shy pup possesses an air of mystery that will surely capture your heart. He may take a little time to warm up, but once he does, you'll find a loving and loyal companion for life.

Brody's gentle nature and innate curiosity have led him to explore the world around him with grace and caution. He's been exposed to various sounds, environments, and experiences, making him a well-socialized and adaptable young pup. Like a true knight, Brody finds solace in the comforting presence of his loved ones and is always ready to offer a warm snuggle or a listening ear.

As his breeder, it's been an absolute pleasure to watch Brody grow and develop his unique personality. He is a true testament to the loving care and attention we have poured into our breeding program. We take pride in raising healthy, happy, and well-adjusted French Bulldogs, and Brody is no exception.

With a heavy heart, we prepare to say "au revoir" to our brave little knight. As he embarks on his new life, we find solace in knowing that he will bring endless joy, love, and laughter to his forever family. Brody will be ready to embark on his noble quest on May 10th, 2023. Before leaving our care, he will be up to date on vaccinations, deworming, and will come with a comprehensive puppy care package, ensuring a smooth transition to his new home.

We invite you to come and meet our little Brody, but instead of in-person, we offer virtual meetings via FaceTime or Zoom. While we may be parting ways with our gallant hero, we take comfort in the knowledge that he will continue to spread love, happiness, and warmth to his new family. Join us in cherishing the time we have left with Brody before he finds his forever home, and let's toast to a beautiful future filled with love, laughter, and wagging tails.
