Meet Paddington!

Paddington is the **little gentleman-explorer** of the litter—always watching, always learning, always ready for the next adventure. Named after the beloved bear from Darkest Peru, this **Blue Sable Fawn** boy has that same curious, *wide-eyed wonder* about the world. He's the puppy who tilts his head when you speak, as if carefully considering every word, then trots over to investigate whatever's caught his attention.

**Nothing escapes Paddington's notice**. A rustling leaf? He's on it. A new toy? He studies it from every angle before deciding how best to play. A kind voice calling his name? He's already padding over, ears perked and eyes bright with interest. His attentive nature makes him **incredibly easy to train**—he watches, he listens, and he genuinely wants to understand what you're teaching him.

But don't let his thoughtful demeanor fool you—Paddington has plenty of playful energy too. After a good romp with his siblings or a thorough exploration of his surroundings, he's more than happy to settle in for a cozy cuddle, preferably with a gentle ear scratch and maybe a treat or two.

He's the perfect companion for a family that appreciates a smart, engaged puppy who's **as sweet as he is clever**.
