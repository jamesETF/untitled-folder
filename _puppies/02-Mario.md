### About The Puppy!

Introducing Mario, our own little superstar, named after the legendary character from the beloved Nintendo franchise! With his laid-back demeanor and love for snuggles, our Mario is ready to level up from our home to yours.

His personality is as gentle as a soft breeze on a sunny afternoon. Mario is the epitome of "cool, calm, and collected". He approaches life with a relaxed gait, his adorable tail wagging leisurely, capturing the essence of his chill persona.

Mario's love for snuggling is legendary. His favorite pastime? Cuddling up in a cozy corner, offering his soft, warm companionship to anyone lucky enough to be near. His heart is as big as his desire for affection, and he's all set to share it with his forever family.

Ready to go home on May 29th or 30th, Mario has his bags packed. He'll be up to date on his shots and can't wait to start his new journey. This chill companion is more than a puppy; he's a friend, a confidante, and a loyal companion, ready to make your home his castle. With Mario, you're not just getting a pet, but a friend who'll be there, offering cuddles and companionship through every level of life.
