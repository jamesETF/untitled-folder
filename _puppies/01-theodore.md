## About The Puppy!
Introducing Theodore, our small yet spunky Fawn French Bulldog! Theodore, small enough to fly with you in a plane, is brimming with personality, exuding sass and charm in every step he takes.

Our delightful Theodore is a sight to behold with his gorgeous fawn coat. He may be small in stature, but he has a big, chunky personality that fills the room. His antics are reminiscent of the cheerful energy and irresistible charm of classic comic characters, making him a heart-stealer from the word go.

Theodore's size makes him a perfect travel companion, especially for air journeys. Imagine little Theodore, your loyal friend, gazing out of the airplane window, sharing every adventure with you!

He'll be ready to fly into your arms and heart on November 4th, up-to-date on all his shots. His loving nature, coupled with his enthusiastic zest for life, makes him more than just a pet; he's a bundle of joy waiting to be a part of your life!
