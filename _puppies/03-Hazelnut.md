### Personality: Well hello there. I’m Hazelnut, or should I say Hazle-nuts..
My name is Hazlenut, but they also call me Hazel, Nut and Nutty. I’m a fawn French Bulldog girl with a black mask. My mom says I’m pretty energetic and that I talk back. I can’t confirm or deny that. But you can come meet me and find out for yourself. 
I will enjoy and thrive in a family that is active, a family with kids that will wear me out by playing and running around the house, or a household with other dogs to keep me company. I’m a social butterfly and I love everyone I meet. If you give me the slightest amount of attention, I will consider you a best friend and start following you around with a little toy in my mouth – which means come play with me. 
I’m ready to go home and maybe you are the right person for me. Please reach out to my parents and let’s schedule a play date. I’m looking forward to meeting you!

### Health: Spunky young lady 
Hazelnut is an active Frenchie girl that adores meal time but also does a fair share of exercising. She chases other puppies around and is always the one to approach others with bringing a toy and inviting them to play. 
Hazel is up to date on all age appropriate shots and she took them like a champ, no complains. She didn’t even make a peep when she got microchipped.
She will still need another DHPP booster and rabies shot to be completely safe to exposure, so don’t expose Hazel to un-vaccinated dogs, or unknown dogs.  

### Feeding:
Hazel eats a mixture of kibble and freshly prepared food. While I usually prepare chicken for the puppies, Hazel prefers fish. She absolutely adores anything fish related. From treats, to supplements, to just straight up raw sardines. Her coat is soft an shiny, and it’s probably due to all the healthy Omega 3 her diet consists of. 
She is fed 3-4x per day and is pretty good at eating slow (which is so rarely seen in French Bulldogs). She takes her time to enjoy her meal. We still add some supplements to her food like a Kefir probiotic and occasionally some fresh turmeric. 
Hazelnut is food motivated so it won’t be too hard to train and completely housebreak her. With consistency, it shouldn’t take longer than a couple of weeks.
