## About Me

 I am a Blue-Merle French Bulldog with some really cool markings scattered around my coat. Let me tell you something; you have never met Frenchie that is anywhere near as bold and brave as me. Nothing scares me, and I do not back down no matter what. Ever heard the term ‚Äúbullheaded?‚Äù Look it up in that dictionary thing, and you will see my picture. I can get into anything, and I will. If something is going down around the house, I will know about it. If you go to the kitchen, I am going with you. If you go outside, you had better have my leash because I am going too. 


## Health: Spunky, well fed and growing by the day. 
Polly is the perfect blue merle little lady and she is growing by the day. By now she had two sets of shots and seemed to react pretty well to both vaccines. She was also dewormed multiple times and we will continue the deworming process until she departs for her forever home. 
Vikki has great nostrils that are not stenotic and she breaths normally without making any out of the ordinary noises. Her snout is slightly pronounced which assures no major breathing issues will arise. She is bred for health and not just for looks only. But of course her beauty is undeniable üòâ 
Polly can be additionally DNA tested for health if required. The Embark DNA test results usually come back in 2-4 weeks. Visit www.embarkvet.com to learn more üòä 

## Feeding:
Polly is food motivated and loves meal time. She is currently fed a mixture of kibble and home cooked food. She sits in the kitchen in patiently waits while we cook her breakfast. Her favorite veggies are carrots, broccoli and peas. Like we always suggest, make sure you transition your Frenchie puppy to a fully fresh food or raw food based diet. Removing kibble from your dogs diet brings many benefits including lean physique, absence of allergies and a longer lifespan. 
A few days a week Vikki gets a probiotic as well as a raw egg added to her food. Other than that she gets a daily Omega 3 supplement, which she is completely obsessed with. We are working on sit and shake while waiting for her Omega 3 treat.
