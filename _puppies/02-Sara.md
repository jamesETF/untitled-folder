### About The Puppy


Introducing Sara, our captivating Blue Merle French Bulldog, named after the sensational Grammy-winning artist, Sara Bareilles! Her coat, a mesmerizing canvas of blue and gray, resembles a beautifully abstract painting, making her stand out in any crowd.

Much like her namesake's soulful and enchanting melodies, Sara has a charm that's hard to resist. Her personality is as colorful and varied as her stunning Blue Merle coat. Her soulful eyes express a depth of emotion that can melt any heart.

Sara has a calm and gentle disposition that pairs perfectly with her distinct beauty. Yet, don't mistake her laid-back attitude for laziness. When it's playtime, Sara is as sprightly as they come, her adorable prance a joy to behold.

Just like Sara Bareilles fills a room with musical delight, our Sara promises to fill your home with warmth, laughter, and companionship. She'll be ready to meet her forever family on May 29th or 30th, and she will come up-to-date on all her shots.

This blue merle beauty isn't just looking for a house; she's looking for a loving home. If you're ready to add a touch of color, a dollop of love, and a symphony of joy to your life, then Sara is the perfect companion for you.
