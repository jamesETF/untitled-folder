### About Me 

 Introducing our dazzling Selena, a rare gem among French Bulldogs, named after the enchanting moon goddess herself. With her mesmerizing blue merle coat and captivating blue eyes, she is destined to illuminate the life of her future forever family. As a passionate and devoted breeder, it brings both joy and a touch of melancholy to present this little moonbeam to her new home.

At just 6 weeks old, our sweet Selena already radiates a calming presence, much like the soothing glow of the moon. Her gentle and tranquil nature, blended with just the right touch of playfulness, makes her an irresistible companion. Like the serene beauty of the moon, she has an innate ability to sense the mood around her and will shower you with unconditional love and warmth, making her a perfect addition to any family.

Little Selena has been exploring and discovering the world around her with a curious twinkle in her eye. She's been exposed to various sounds, environments, and experiences, making her a well-socialized and confident little lady. And even though she adores her lunar adventures, she equally enjoys cuddling up for a cozy nap, making her the ultimate celestial snuggle buddy.

As her breeder, it's been an absolute pleasure to watch Selena grow and develop her unique personality. She is a true testament to the loving care and attention we have poured into our breeding program. We take pride in raising healthy, happy, and well-adjusted French Bulldogs, and Selena is no exception.

With a heavy heart, we prepare to say "au revoir" to our precious moon goddess. As she embarks on her new life, we find solace in knowing that she will bring endless joy, love, and laughter to her forever family. Selena will be ready to light up her new home on May 10th, 2023. Before leaving our care, she will be up to date on vaccinations, deworming, and will come with a comprehensive puppy care package, ensuring a smooth transition to her new home.

You're welcome to meet our little Selena over facetime or zoom, but be warned â€“ her enchanting eyes and charming personality will steal your heart in an instant. Join us in cherishing the time we have left with our moonbeam before she finds her forever home, and let's toast to a beautiful future filled with love, laughter, and wagging tails.
