### About The Puppy!

Meet Timothy, our tiny bundle of pure sass and joy! Just like his namesake, the incredible Timoth√©e Chalamet, this little guy may be small in size, but his personality could easily fill a room!

Our little Timothy is not just any puppy; he's an enchanting spectacle of shimmering blue. His coat, a delightful shade of cobalt, seems to change hues under different lights, just like the Mediterranean sea. One look into his expressive eyes and you'll find yourself lost in a world of puppy love.

With a personality as vibrant as his coat, Timothy embodies the term 'small but mighty'. His pint-sized stature doesn't keep him from having larger-than-life dreams. Like a little explorer, he's always on a quest, sniffing out every nook and cranny, inspecting toys, and curiously trying to understand this big world around him.

Don't be fooled by his curiosity, though. Timothy has a playful and sassy side that is guaranteed to keep you entertained. He's got a strut that would make any catwalk model envious, and a penchant for play that never seems to wane. With his high-energy antics and charming personality, there will never be a dull moment in your home.

Timothy is excitedly counting down the days until he can meet his new family. He'll be ready to go home on the 29th or 30th of May, up to date on shots and with a clean bill of health. Not only does he promise endless fun and cuddles, but also the assurance of being a well-cared-for pup.

Our pint-sized prince, Timothy, is more than just a pet. He's a loyal companion, a playful entertainer, and an unconditional lover. He's patiently waiting to fill your home with laughter, joy, and the purest form of love only a puppy can give. Get ready to embark on the most beautiful journey of companionship with our adorable Timothy.
