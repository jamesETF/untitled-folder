## About Me

 Introducing Tubs, a delightful Merle French Bulldog puppy and the endearing sibling of Selena, Brody, and Kane. As a passionate breeder, we're thrilled to present this charming little pup to his future forever family.

At just 6 weeks old, Tubs has already captured our hearts with his irresistible cuddliness and lovable nature. His round, tubby appearance only adds to his undeniable charm. Tubs enjoys leisurely strolls, gentle play, and snuggling up for a cozy nap, making him the perfect companion for a family seeking a laid-back, affectionate friend.

As Tubs' breeder, we take pride in raising healthy, happy, and well-adjusted French Bulldogs. Tubs will be ready to bring his heartwarming presence to his new home on May 10th, 2023. He'll be up to date on vaccinations, deworming, and will come with a comprehensive puppy care package.

We invite you to meet our adorable Tubs via FaceTime or Zoom, where his charming demeanor and lovable personality will surely melt your heart. Join us in cherishing our time with Tubs before he finds his forever home, and let's toast to a future filled with love, laughter, and wagging tails.
