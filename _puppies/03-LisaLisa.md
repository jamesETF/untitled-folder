### Personality: Hey! My name is Lisa Lisa because you'll "Love me, from head to toe!"

 ["Ooohhh Baby I think you'll love me, from head to toe!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51Iq8JmmfxY){:target="_blank"} Can you hear it? thats my theme  music!

 Iâ€™m a very special colored French Bulldog baby girl. My color is called blue merle. My body is light blue (merle) with little tiger stripes all over. Iâ€™m adorable as you can see from the pictures and Iâ€™m trying to find my perfect home. Personality wise Iâ€™m extremely sweet and snuggly, friendly with my fellow puppers and cuddly with humans. I love running around the house and having other dogs chase me. Iâ€™m smart and hide under the couch because I know thatâ€™s where they canâ€™t get me. 
Mom calls me queen of snuggles and I really live up to the name. When Iâ€™m not playing with my toys or spending around the house, I like to make myself comfortable in the most perfect place â€“ the human lap. My ideal human is going to be one who enjoys spending their afternoons just chilling on the couch and avoiding the cold weather. If this sounds like you, I think we might get along. 

### Health: Spunky, well fed and growing by the day. 

Lisa Lisa is the perfect blue merle little lady and she is growing by the day. By now she had two sets of shots and seemed to react pretty well to both vaccines. She was also dewormed multiple times and we will continue the deworming process until she departs for her forever home. 
Vikki has great nostrils that are not stenotic and she breaths normally without making any out of the ordinary noises. Her snout is slightly pronounced which assures no major breathing issues will arise. She is bred for health and not just for looks only. But of course her beauty is undeniable ðŸ˜‰ 
Lisa Lisa's parents have been DNA tested and we can share those results upon request!

### Feeding:

Lisa Lisa is food motivated and loves meal time. She is currently fed a mixture of kibble and home cooked food. She sits in the kitchen in patiently waits while we cook her breakfast. Her favorite veggies are carrots, broccoli and peas. Like we always suggest, make sure you transition your Frenchie puppy to a fully fresh food or raw food based diet. Removing kibble from your dogs diet brings many benefits including lean physique, absence of allergies and a longer lifespan. 
A few days a week Vikki gets a probiotic as well as a raw egg added to her food. Other than that she gets a daily Omega 3 supplement, which she is completely obsessed with. We are working on sit and shake while waiting for her Omega 3 treat.
