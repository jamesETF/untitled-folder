title: Hobby Frenchie Breeders - Disrupting the Puppymill to Petstore Model
---

We are re-defining the pet store, with transparency and a focus on socialization, health, and temperament. Just as people want to know where their food comes from, so should they know exactly where that Frenchie in the window came from as well. We are aiming to disrupt the traditional large-scale breeder -> dealer -> pet store network format. With an education, engagement, and relationship focus. 

If you learn more about Frenchies from us than anywhere else before making your decision to bring home a furbaby, we have done our job. So whether it was bred by us, or by a partner breeder you can rest assured that your relationship will continue with the actual breeder. If we’re putting our brand on the line, its more important than ever for us to pick and choose the healthiest and best puppies from the most responsible Frenchie breeders, and match them with only the best families. Anyone can “add a Frenchie to cart” on any of the find a puppy websites or craigslist advertisements online. 

Only Ethical Frenchie will put the same (if not more) effort and due diligence into cutting through the noise and educating you as thoroughly as possible, whether you get a puppy from us or not. Aside from our private in-home visits for approved families, you can look forward to our Frenchie pop-up locations in NY and surrounding areas complete with breeders, cute little outfit brands and homemade puppy food brands.
