title: About Tammy
---

### Personality: Hey! My name is Tammy, I’m the cool guy of the litter. 
I’m a Cream Fawn French Bulldog puppy for sale located in New York City.  . 
You won’t see another French Bulldog Puppy like me strutting the streets of NYC or surrounding areas.  
I’m loving, playful but also like to keep my brothers and sisters on their toes. They definitely get their daily amount of exercise with me in the house.

### Health: I don’t even have to explain how healthy I am, my running around and jumping explains it. 
Fawn French Bulldog Puppies have a coat that is a little more "coffee" than regular white, so they do need a quality shampoo to keep that light coat looking clean and shiny, especailly between the folds of my snout and around my eyes.  So prepare to pamper her! 

We recommend using this hypoallergenic shampoo. 
Before I go home I will receive 2 sets of shots, heatworm prevention treatment, tick and flea treatment, deworming and I will also get microchipped. 
Vet will issue a fresh health certificate before I leave.
 
### Feeding: Tammy, just like her siblings eats the same mixture of kibble and Fresh Pet Chicken food. 
But she does like to pTammy around when the adults are being fed – they are being fed a raw diet. So it looks like little Tammy has a very big interest in the raw diet himself. Hmmm?

Tammy is also getting her daily multivitamin and Omega 3 supplement from The Natural Pet Company. I’m obsessed with every product they put out and they work great for French Bulldogs and their sensitive skin.
