title: About Lord Admiral Nelson
---

### Personality: Hey! My name is Lord Admiral Nelson, I have been known to cause humans to fall off their bicycles. 
The first time you will ever see or think the words "Pizzazz & Candor" will be the day you have the privilege to meet me.  I am celebrity, I am Lord Admiral Nelson and I am seeking a human to adopt.  I have a few requirements for my human.
1. First of all they must understand that i cause traffic jams. Outside of "Sunday Brunch" in SOHO I've managed to bring quite a few ladies to tears. I'm simply irresistible, and due to this fact you will have to keep an eye on me at all times. I'm like a loose diamond rolling down the street on a leash. Don't take yoru eyes off me.


### Health: I don’t even have to explain how healthy I am, my running around and jumping explains it. 
I'm considering a new primary care veterinarian, the one i'm seeing insists i must wait in the lobby among the... how should is say? "commonpups". 

We recommend using this hypoallergenic shampoo. 
Before I go home I will receive 2 sets of shots, heartworm prevention treatment, tick and flea treatment, deworming and I will also get microchipped. 
Vet will issue a fresh health certificate before I leave.
 
### Feeding: Lord Admiral Nelson, just like his siblings eats the same mixture of kibble and Fresh Pet Chicken food. 
Lord Admiral Nelson commands the puppies around him to step aside during his mealtime. He uses a spork and bib when consuming sampling the various delicacies chosen especially for him by his pet human.  Sometimes he chastises his human for switching the menu too abruptly as it tends to make him a tid bit gassy. He wants to be fed like a king and will most certainly bit the hand that feeds him (not literally, but maybe with a snarky look)

Lord Admiral Nelson is also getting his daily multivitamin and Omega 3 supplement from The Natural Pet Company. I’m obsessed with every product they put out and they work great for French Bulldogs and their sensitive skin.
