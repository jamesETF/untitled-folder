title: About Theo
---

### Personality: Hey! My name is Theo and I will spice up your life.
I’m a blue French Bulldog for sale in NY, so if you are located in this area, come meet me. (I can also catch a flight to you!)
I’m spunky and always on the go. My favorite things are running up and down the house and mom surprising me with a brand new Kong toy. Especially If there is peanut butter in it.
I’m a super friendly boy and love meeting new people, animals and places. I’m well behaved and will be the start of the show no matter where we go. 


### Health: I don’t even have to explain how healthy I am, my running around and jumping explains it. 
Theo is chunky and healthy. He comes from genetically tested parents and healthy bloodlines, so with the right care from his new owners, Theo will live a long, healthy life.
Before Theo goes home our vet will issue a fresh health certificate that confirms he is healthy, clear of any abnormalities and up to date on shots. 
All our blue French Bulldog Puppies for sale get extensively examined by the vet before we even entertain the thought of placing them in their forever homes.

 
### Feeding:  
Theo loves meal time. He will sit next to his bowl and patiently wait for his food to be ready. He will sit and wait on command, as well. Needles to say we have a very good boy here.
Like we previously mentioned we are huge supporters of raw feeding as well as fresh food feeding. We believe it goes a long way and will keep your Frenchie healthy, in great shape and free of allergies.
