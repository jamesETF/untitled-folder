We are re-defining the pet store, with transparency and a focus on socialization, health, and temperament. Just as people want to know where their food comes from, so should they know exactly where their potential new puppy came from as well.

> Don't "add a puppy to cart" at another site, and instead read more about how passionate we are about our frenchies. We'd be happy with that much, whether you decide to get a puppy from us or not. 

The amount of time that we invest into breeding and hand raising our French Bulldog puppies shows in our commitment after you take your baby home. Unlike most breeders we stay in touch at all life stages of your new puppies lives. Which is why our [Instagram](https://instagram.com/ethicalfrenchie) is dominated by happy families, months and years AFTER they brought their frenchie home. If weâ€™re putting our brand on the line, its more important than ever for us to raise the healthiest and best french bulldog puppies and match them with only the best families.
