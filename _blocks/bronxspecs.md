title: About Bronx
---

### Personality: Hi! My name is Bronx and I’m an adorable blue French Bulldog who loves to chew your documents.

I’m located in New York city and one of my favorite things are: destroying each toy, beg for treats, explore the bathroom for no reason other than peeking inside the toilet. 
I’m a social butterfly and have no issues making friends – dog or human ones. I met a cat one time and I’m sure I would make friends with your cat as well; in case you have one. 


### Health: I’m a healthy blue Frenchie boy. I love to eat and grow bigger every day 
My mom thinks I will be a big and muscular boy. 
I love the vet and can’t even feel it when he gives me the shots, due to all my baby fat protecting me. 
Before I go home, I will receive 2 sets of shots, heartworm prevention treatment, tick and flea treatment, deworming and I will also get microchipped. 

 
### Feeding: Bronx, just like his siblings eats the same mixture of kibble and Fresh Pet Chicken food. 

Bronx eats a mixture of kibble and Fresh Pet foot, combined with some bone broth. He also receives a daily multivitamin and omega 3 supplement.
Omega 3 help with the sensitive French Bulldog skin and keep their coat looking nice.
