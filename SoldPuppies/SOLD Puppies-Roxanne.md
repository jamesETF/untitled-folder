## About Me

Roxanne is another solid blue merle beauty. Kona’s little twin, but completely different personality wise. Roxanne is a sweet and calm baby girl that loves being held and cuddled. Of course she doesn’t mind a nice play/tug of war session, but there is nothing she loves more than being spoiled by humans. 
Roxanne is healthy and has an extremely soft and shiny coat. All our puppies were weaned on to a fully raw diet, which gives them a better start at life and assure longevity, as well as prevents allergies and skin issues bulldogs can be prone to. 

She is looking for her forever home and is not picky. Lots of love and cuddles is all she requires. Her looks are out of this world and unique, but deep down she’s a simple girl. So are you the perfect human for Roxanne?
