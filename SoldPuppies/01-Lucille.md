## About Me

Lucille is our blue pied beauty. She was definitely the most progressive puppy in the litter. She was the biggest one at birth, first one to open her eyes, develop teeth and have a taste of raw food. 
She is the leader, super smart and will bring great joy into your household. Her great personality and unique markings make this little baby the most perfect French Bulldog puppy. 
Her perfect human is one that will fall in love with her at first sight and look no further. If you are that human definitely reach out and schedule your virtual meet and greet with Lucille. She is excited to meet you!
