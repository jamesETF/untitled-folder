## About Aria
Aria is a black merle pied French bulldog. A truly beautiful little girl, looking just like her mommy Carmen. 
Her personality is easy going and chill, but she of course still loves her playtime and all the toys the Ethical Frenchie household has to offer. Being for snacks is another hobby she loves and is considered a professional at, so definitely make sure you have snacks to offer before bringing Aria home.
