## About Me

I am an exotic tastefully dark blue French Bulldog puppy with a very sophisticated taste fur high quality stuff. I am the purfect lady at all times. I dress fur success and I am very careful to stay very clean. Well, unless there is good quality mud available. Then, everyone knows a mud bath is great for the pores. While I might come across as pretentious at first, I am really kind reserved almost to the point of being called shy. I do not mind that everyone else gets all of the attention as long as I get some too. I like to hang back analyze and assess the situation before fully committing to anything. Well, unless there is food; I like food. Me and my siblings live in a part of New York City called Manhattan. We are so lucky because we have a rooftop play area where we go can look out at the skyline and see everything. The play area is the best place in the world to have some privacy as my siblings lay out and soak in some sunshine. It may not be the South of France, but it is very nice. We like to stretch out on our bellies with our back legs pointed away from our noses. I do not care what humans think, my legs do not look like frog legs when I am all stretched out like that.

I am a very healthy Frenchie who was born on November 23rd, yes while you were eating Thanksgiving Dinner and going Black Friday Shopping I was just trying to learn how to open myeyes. If I counted my toes right, that means that I am 8 weeks old turning 9 this weekend. The vet makes sure to tell my humans that we are all very healthy. I listen to them talking and they have no idea that I understand English as well as French. Please do not tell them! When other humans first see me, they tell me how exceedingly stunning and strong I look. If they could only see below my brand name coat, they would see that I work out regularly. I can bench press a whole bucket of chicken! You may notice me checking out my appearance in every mirror I pass. I am very fastidious because I know looks are important.


## Personality

When something goes down, I am happy to let everyone else get there first. By the time I arrive, I can make a grand entrance making sure everyone notices my style. Sometimes, I take care of more important stuff first like getting petted, having my ears scratched, getting my belly rubbed, or eating. They can either wait on me or not. When the balls are rolling, however, I am all over that. Playing is high on my list of priorities. Toys are always fun. Even though I am more reserved than most, I still need lots of toys. I like studying things and the more toys I have, the more interest I have in studying them.

I know there are plenty of beautiful Frenchies fur adoption, but I will definitely make things in your household more elegant because I am all that and a cup of high-quality kibble. Trust me, I am always ready to go and because I am always dressed to impress, I am the purfect accessory to whatever outfit you wear. I mean, think about it: who would not want to accessorize with genuine Amber? If you are looking to use me as a babe or hunk magnet, I have your six. Say the word and I will do my best runway walk to help you look even better.


## Health

No question that I am healthy; I mean, look at this physique! The vet has seen me several times, and I have my shots. (Grrrrrrr!) Do not listen to the rumors about how us blue Frenchies have skin issues. None of my relatives have any problems with their skin or anything else. The secret is feeding me the right food, giving me healthy treats, petting me 32 hours per day, making sure I play, giving me healthy treats, giving me belly rubs, and using only quality bath products. (Did I mention treats?)

I am a Frenchie, and we have very particular needs. You should probably do a little research before getting your heart set on one of us. Our faces make us very desirable because it looks like we chased a cement wall. How many other animals have you seen whose eyes can look inside their own nostrils? Just kidding! Mostly. Brachycephalic is the name. It means our faces are squished flat and we sometimes have trouble breathing easily. Because of the short nasal passages, you better like snorting and snoring…oh, and farting.

## What I Need in a Human

Not to brag or anything, but I am an excellent accessory fur any kind of human as long as you are ready to play and you understand your role includes buying me toys. When you buy toys, think of what a Tasmanian Devil with the bite force of an alligator will do to it. If it will last more than ten minutes, then that is a toy made fur a Frenchie. Of course, I LOVE pulling the stuffing out of toys, but you have to watch as I do because sometimes, I eat the stuff. (Hey! The commercials say to eat more fiber. If they did not mean that fiber, they should have said so.) I like long walks on trails, in the bark, I mean park, or on the beach, only you have to be sure it is not too hot or not too cold. Both can cause breathing problems after just a few minutes of exertion. I do need exercise, I do need to run, I do need to catch squirrels, and I do need to dig. The one thing I do not need to do is swim. Our bodies are made to sink like a pallet of bricks, and since we have no snout, swimming pushes water into our nostrils. Trust me; it is not a good thing. Now, playing in the rain is a different story. That [bleep], excuse my French, is fun!

Just because I am so easy going, do not think fur a minute that I am a pushover: I am a Frenchie. My temporary humans are making me tell you that Frenchies are very stubborn. (They said something very mean about us having thick skulls.) Since I am so curious about things, I add mystery to thick-headedness. You also need to like to cuddle – a lot. If you ever furget to give lots of belly rubs, I will remind you. Ooh, and ear scratches, those are important. Plus, you have to promise to take me to the vet regularly.

No tricks here, if you have refined tastes, then I am the man fur you. I hope you do not mind the French accent, but the girls tell me it gives me a certain avec élégance. I think that is French fur hawt and sexy.
