### Personality: Hi! My name is Emily and I'm 4 months old :-(
I havenâ€™t found a perfect home yet, My Pawrents say its because i was the biggest puppy in my litter, and everybody wants the smallest.  When families come to visit, i'm always super excited to go home, but then they take my little sisters or brothers instead.  I do my best to put on my pretties face and personality, I groom myself to make myself look cute, but alas. I am still waiting on my furever home.

James has really treated me like a queen, and he says that if nobody takes me home, that he will keep me forever. Even when new puppies arrive from other litters or other breeders, I am now much more big compared to them! and the same thing happens, the human families come, and they pick the smallest puppies they see. sometimes i wish i didn't grow so big, so that i can grow with my future family and their children, afterall, i'm only 4 months old, I'm still learning, and you'll have me forever!

My time will come any day now. James said I was special, he said I was a "Christmas Puppy", my siblings were too.  However they all went to their furever homes during the holidays.. and now its Valentines day and i'm still here. Deep down i'm hoping that some human makes their mate very angry to the extent that the only thing that can save their relationship is myself or a Diamond or a New Lexus or something!  Don't get me wrong, I dont wish bad vibes on anyone.. I'm just being strategic ;-) I'm cheaper than a Diamond anyway! (at least up front). Iâ€™m very friendly and outgoing. My mind is set on play mode 80% of the time, so my pawfect home would be one with either kids or other dogs. Playing fetch, tug of war and wrestling around are my favorite things to do. 
Donâ€™t get me wrong. I do settle down and love cuddles as well, but Iâ€™m generally pretty excited and eager to explore the world. If your family loves to explore as well please reach out to Ethical Frenchie today! Looking forward to having lots of fun and going on new adventures with you ðŸ˜Š

### Health: 
Emily is a chunky and healthy girl. She is up to date on her shots, regularly dewormed and microchipped. She comes from healthy bloodlines and health tested parents. Additional  health testing can be done if required by using Embark Vet, which is basically a 23 & me for dogs and screens for more than 160 health conditions that can occur in our canine companions. 
Even though Chelsea is a Blue  which falls under more exotic and rare colorings, there is no health issues associated with the  gene whatsoever. 
This girl is growing by the day and waiting for the perfect human to spoil her with good food and healthy snacks. 

### Feeding:
Oh boy! Emily loves to eat. We feed her a wide variety of foods and she loves every single one of them. Chelsea eats home cooked food mixed with some raw freeze dried Stella&Chewyâ€™s Dinner patties. WE switch it up with her veggies but her favorite so far have been carrots and celery sticks. If you love cooking you will enjoy preparing food for this lady, but if not, then there are lots of food subscriptions that will deliver the food to you. Sheâ€™s not picky so Iâ€™m sure she will find it equally delicious. 
We mix in a Kefir probiotic to her food daily, to promote gut health, as well as some salmon oil for an Omega 3 boost! 
She will thrive on a raw or fresh food based diet, so feel free to experiment with her diet. Her stomach is not sensitive, and she likes versatility.
