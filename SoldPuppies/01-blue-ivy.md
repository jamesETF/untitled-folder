Meet Blue Ivy!  

Blue Ivy may be the runt of her litter, but she has a heart full of love waiting for the right family. Her beautiful Blue Merle coat is striking on its own, but what makes her truly unforgettable is her single bright blue eye—a rare feature that sets her apart. Being smaller than her siblings has made her a little shy and gentle, but also wonderfully patient. She’s the thoughtful one who likes to watch before she joins in, and when she does, she bonds deeply.  

Blue Ivy is perfect for a family who appreciates a quieter, more careful pup. She thrives on calm environments and is happiest when snuggling close, soaking up affection. Her mix of gentleness and resilience makes her a lifelong companion who will reward her family with unwavering loyalty.
