## About Me

Meet our sweet Kona girl. Kona is a blue merle French Bulldog girl that is energetic, happy and in great health. She is 6 weeks old and will depart for her forever home in just a short few weeks. 
Konaâ€™s ideal family is one with an energetic play buddy that will keep her on her toes. This spunky girl definitely has lots of energy to burn so a home with kids or another playful canine companion would be ideal.
