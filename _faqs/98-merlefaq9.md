title: How do I find a responsible merle Frenchie breeder?

The most important question you can ask any merle breeder is whether both parents were DNA tested for merle gene status. A responsible breeder will also never breed two merle parents together and will be completely transparent about their breeding process. If something feels rushed or the price seems too good to be true, trust your instincts.
