French Bulldogs are one of the best breeds for families with children. They're patient, playful, and naturally affectionate — they love being around people of all ages. Their small but sturdy build means they can handle the energy of kids without being fragile. That said, we always recommend supervising interactions between any dog and very young children, and teaching kids how to handle a puppy gently. Most of our families have children, and the feedback is always the same — their Frenchie becomes the kids' best friend.
