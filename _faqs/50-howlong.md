The process is very quick and only takes a few minutes to get pre-approved. After the paperwork is filled out by both parties, we can start scheduling the date of the puppy pick up/delivery. We work with a highly reliable flight nanny in case the delivery to another state Is required. The cost of the flight nanny (if you are out of state) can be included in your financing fee as well.
