The process is very quick and only takes a few minutes to get pre-approved. After the paperwork is filled out by both parties, we can start scheduling the date of the puppy pick up/delivery. We personally deliver to out-of-state families — your puppy flies in-cabin with us, never with a stranger. The delivery fee (if you are out of state) can be included in your financing as well.
