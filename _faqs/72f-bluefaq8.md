Yes, blue Frenchies are wonderful family dogs. We have placed them with families of all sizes — singles, couples, and first-time dog owners — and they always adapt without a problem. They are affectionate, easygoing, and do great in apartments or houses. The blue color is the only thing that sets them apart from a standard Frenchie; the personality is exactly the same.
