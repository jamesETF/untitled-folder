title: Are French Bulldogs a good fit for Atlanta living?
categories: [atlantafaq]

French Bulldogs do great in Atlanta — they're perfect for condos and apartments in Midtown, Buckhead, or any neighborhood around the city. The main thing to be mindful of is Atlanta's hot, humid summers. Frenchies are sensitive to heat because of their flat faces, so keep outdoor time short during peak heat, always have water, and make sure your home has good AC. Morning and evening walks are best during summer months. Other than heat management, Frenchies are ideal for ATL life — friendly, compact, low-maintenance, and always down for a ride to the BeltLine.
