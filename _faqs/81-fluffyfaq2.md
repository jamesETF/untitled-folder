title: How much do Fluffy French Bulldogs cost?
categories: [fluffyfaq]
---
Fluffy French Bulldogs are among the most expensive Frenchies due to their extreme rarity. Both parents must carry the recessive Lh gene, which significantly limits the breeding pool. Prices from reputable breeders typically range from $6,000 and up, depending on color combination, lineage, and demand. As with any rare Frenchie, if the price seems too good to be true, it probably is — always ask for genetic test results and health documentation. [Contact us](/contact-us/) about fluffy availability.
