title: Are fluffy Frenchies purebred?

Yes, 100% purebred — we get this question a lot and the answer is always the same. The fluffy coat comes from the FGF5 gene which has always existed in the French Bulldog bloodline; there is no other breed involved. We confirm purebred status through Embark DNA testing so there is never any doubt.
