title: How rare are Fluffy French Bulldogs?
categories: [fluffyfaq]
---
Fluffy Frenchies are the rarest variation of French Bulldog available today. The long-hair gene (Lh) is recessive, meaning both parents must carry it — and even then, only a portion of each litter will be fluffy. This makes planned fluffy litters uncommon and waitlists long. If you're interested in a fluffy Frenchie, we recommend getting on our waitlist early. We prioritize matching the right puppy with the right family, not first-come-first-served.
