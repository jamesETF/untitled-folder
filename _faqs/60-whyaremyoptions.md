You can always reach out to local rescues, or nationwide French Bulldog rescues and open your home to a French Bulldog adult in need. Another suggestion that we have would be reaching out to local breeders and inquiring about their adult French Bulldogs that they are planning to retire. The fee is usually anything between 500-1000$, depending on the breeder and the area.
