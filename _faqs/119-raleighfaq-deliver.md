title: Do you deliver French Bulldog puppies to Raleigh?
categories: [raleighfaq]

Yes — we deliver to Raleigh and the entire Triangle area (Durham, Chapel Hill). Your puppy travels in-cabin with a trusted flight nanny into RDU Airport. The nanny hands off your puppy personally at arrival. We also welcome Raleigh families to visit and pick up in person at either our New York City or Chicago location.
