Color Dilution Alopecia (CDA) is a genetic skin condition that causes hair thinning and coat loss in dilute-colored dogs — but it's most commonly associated with Dobermans and blue Weimaraners, not French Bulldogs. In Frenchies, true CDA is actually quite rare. We have never experienced a case, at least not to our knowledge. The hair loss or skin issues you might see in a blue or lilac Frenchie are much more likely to be seasonal alopecia, food allergies, and so on — all of which are manageable with the right diet and care. Don't let Google scare you on this one.
