French Bulldogs are extremely sensitive to heat:
- Avoid outdoor activities during peak heat hours
- Provide constant access to fresh, cool water
- Use cooling mats or vests
- Keep them in air-conditioned spaces
- Never leave them in parked cars
- Watch for signs of overheating: excessive panting, drooling, or lethargy
- Limit exercise during hot weather
