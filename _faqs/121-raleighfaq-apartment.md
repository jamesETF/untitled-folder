French Bulldogs thrive in Raleigh — whether you're in a downtown apartment, a house near NC State, or out in the suburbs. They don't need a big yard and they're happy just being with their family. Raleigh's mild winters are great for Frenchies, but summer heat and humidity are a concern — keep outdoor time moderate during the hottest months and always have water and shade available. Raleigh's growing dog-friendly culture (breweries, parks, greenways) makes it a perfect city for a Frenchie companion.
