title: Can I visit and meet the puppies if I'm in Atlanta?
categories: [atlantafaq]

You're always welcome to visit us — we have family homes in both New York City and Chicago, so depending on where your puppy is, you'd visit one of those locations. From Atlanta it's a quick 2-hour direct flight to either city. For families who can't make the trip, we offer FaceTime and video calls so you can see your puppy and their parents before committing. We believe in full transparency — if a breeder won't show you the puppy on video, that's a red flag.
