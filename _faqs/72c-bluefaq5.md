Color Dilution Alopecia (CDA) is a genetic skin condition associated with dilute-colored dogs, but it is most commonly seen in Dobermans and is actually quite rare in French Bulldogs. Any skin or coat issues that blue or lilac Frenchies experience are much more likely to be related to food allergies, environmental sensitivities, or seasonal changes.
