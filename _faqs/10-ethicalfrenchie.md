We breed a wide range of French Bulldog colors, each with their own unique personality and look:
- [Blue French Bulldogs](/puppies/upcoming-colors/blue-french-bulldog) — a diluted black coat with a signature steel-blue hue
- [Lilac French Bulldogs](/puppies/upcoming-colors/lilac-french-bulldog) — a rare champagne/purple tone, one of the most sought-after colors
- [Merle French Bulldogs](/puppies/upcoming-colors/merle-french-bulldog) — a striking mottled pattern that makes every puppy unique
- [Fluffy French Bulldogs](/puppies/upcoming-colors/fluffy-french-bulldog) — longer, softer coats caused by the Lh gene
- Plus cream, fawn, brindle, pied, and other standard AKC colors

Blue, Merle, Lilac, and Fluffy Frenchies are priced higher due to rarity and additional genetic testing. Regardless of color, health and temperament always come first. [Browse our available puppies](/french-bulldog-puppies/).
