Merle can appear across many color combinations. Here at Ethical Frenchie, we have produced blue merles, lilac merles, chocolate merles, and merle with tan points. Each puppy's pattern is completely unique depending on the base color underneath. Lilac merles and blue merles tend to be the most popular with our buyers.
