title: What is a fluffy French Bulldog?
categories: [fluffyfaq]
---
A fluffy French Bulldog is a 100% purebred Frenchie with a longer, softer coat caused by the FGF5 gene. They are not a mix or a different breed — the fluffy coat is a naturally occurring recessive gene that has always existed in the French Bulldog bloodline. Both parents need to carry the gene in order to produce fluffy puppies.
