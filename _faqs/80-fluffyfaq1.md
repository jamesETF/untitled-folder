title: What makes a French Bulldog "fluffy"?
categories: [fluffyfaq]
---
Fluffy French Bulldogs carry the long-hair gene (Lh), which produces a softer, longer coat compared to the standard short-haired Frenchie. They're still 100% purebred French Bulldogs — the Lh gene is a naturally occurring recessive trait that both parents must carry. Fluffy Frenchies have the same temperament, size, and personality as any other Frenchie — they're just a lot more cuddly to hold. Their coat does require a bit more grooming (regular brushing), but they don't shed excessively.
