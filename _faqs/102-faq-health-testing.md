title: What health testing do your breeding dogs go through?
categories: [aboutfaq, faqpage-about]

Every one of our adult French Bulldogs goes through extensive veterinary exams and genetic testing before breeding. Our dogs are tested and cleared for:
- **CMR1** (Canine Multifocal Retinopathy) — an inherited eye condition
- **DM** (Degenerative Myelopathy) — a progressive spinal cord disease
- **HUU** (Hyperuricosuria) — a urinary condition causing bladder stones
- **JHC** (Juvenile Hereditary Cataracts) — early-onset cataracts

We also screen for hip dysplasia, patellar luxation, and cardiac issues. We invest $5,000–$50,000+ per breeding female in health testing because cutting corners isn't an option when you're putting your name behind every puppy.
