title: Do lilac French Bulldogs have blue eyes?
categories: [lilacfaq]

Lilac French Bulldog puppies are born with blue eyes, but just like with human babies, their eye color changes as they age. As they mature, their eyes will transition into a light green or yellow-green color. True blue eyes in an adult Frenchie are not a genetic trait that falls under this breed.
