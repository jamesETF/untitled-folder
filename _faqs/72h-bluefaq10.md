Always ask to see genetic testing on both parents, and make sure the breeder is transparent about what is and isn't included in the price. A good breeder will welcome your questions and not rush you into a decision. If a price seems too low or a breeder isn't being transparent and responsive, those would be red flags worth paying attention to.
