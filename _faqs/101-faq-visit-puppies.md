Yes! We welcome and encourage visits. We want you to feel 100% confident in your decision, and meeting your puppy (and their parents) in person is the best way to do that. We have family homes in both New York City and Chicago — just reach out to schedule a time at whichever location your puppy is at. For families who can't visit in person, we're happy to FaceTime or video call so you can see your puppy and ask any questions before committing. Any breeder who won't let you see the puppies on video is a red flag.
