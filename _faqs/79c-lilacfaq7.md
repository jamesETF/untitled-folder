Lilac Frenchies carry the blue (d) and traditional chocolate (b) genes, resulting in a silvery coat. Isabella Frenchies — also known as Champagne Lilacs — carry the blue (d) gene combined with the testable cocoa gene instead. Isabellas have a warm orange undertone, while lilac French Bulldogs have a cool purple undertone.
