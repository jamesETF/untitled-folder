title: How much do fluffy French Bulldogs cost?
categories: [fluffyfaq]
---
Our fluffy French Bulldog puppies are priced between $6,000 and $8,500, and every puppy comes with lifetime breeder support, health guarantee, vaccines, deworming, microchip, and AKC registration if sold with breeding rights. You will see fluffies listed online anywhere from suspiciously cheap to $20,000–$30,000. Both ends of that spectrum should give you pause. A good breeder prices based on quality and rarity, not hype.
