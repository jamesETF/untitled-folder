Yes, fluffy French Bulldogs can be AKC registered, but like other exotic colors and coat types they do not fall under the AKC's approved breed standard. That means they can be registered as a French Bulldog but would not be eligible for conformation shows. For most families that is completely irrelevant — they just want a healthy, lovable companion.
