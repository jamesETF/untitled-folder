Important questions to ask any French Bulldog breeder:
- Can you provide health testing results for both parents?
- Can I meet the parent dogs?
- Are the puppies registered with AKC or another reputable organization?
- What health guarantee do you provide?
- Can you provide references from previous clients?
- How do you socialize your puppies?
- What ongoing support do you offer after purchase?
- Are you transparent about which puppies you bred directly vs. sourced from other breeders?
