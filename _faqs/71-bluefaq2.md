What is called "Blue" is visually (to the eye) a grey French Bulldog.  It is the dilutent gene (dd) that lightens the coat color of what was genetically a black Frenchie. This "color diluting gene" makes the base "black color" look more gray with a blue hue.  therefor all blue Frenchies are black Frenchies with the color diluting gene.
