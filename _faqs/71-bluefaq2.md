title: What makes a French Bulldog "blue"?
categories: [bluefaq]
---
A blue French Bulldog is genetically a black Frenchie with the dilute gene (dd). This color dilution gene lightens the black pigment to a steel-gray with a blue hue — which is why they're called "blue" even though they look gray to the eye. Both parents must carry at least one copy of the dilute gene to produce blue offspring. Blue Frenchies can also come in combinations like blue fawn, blue pied, blue and tan, or blue merle — each with their own unique look.
