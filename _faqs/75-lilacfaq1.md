categories: [lilacfaq]

A lilac French Bulldog is a result of a unique combination of the blue (d) gene and chocolate (b) gene, resulting in something called double dilution. Due to this double dilution, lilac Frenchies have a very light gray coat as well as thinner hair. They will shed less but get colder faster.
