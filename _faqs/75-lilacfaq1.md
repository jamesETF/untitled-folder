title: What makes a French Bulldog "lilac"?
categories: [lilacfaq]
---
A lilac French Bulldog carries two copies of both the chocolate gene (bb) and the dilute gene (dd). This double dilution produces a unique champagne or pale purple-brown coat that's lighter than blue and warmer than standard colors. Lilac Frenchies often have light-colored eyes (green, blue, or amber) and a pink or light-brown nose. They're one of the most sought-after colors in the breed because of how striking and rare the combination is.
