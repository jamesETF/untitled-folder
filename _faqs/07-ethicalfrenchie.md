title: What health issues should I know about with French Bulldogs?
categories: [ethicalfrenchie, faqpage-breed]
---

French Bulldogs can be prone to several health conditions due to their brachycephalic (flat-faced) structure:
- **Breathing issues:** Due to their shortened airways (BOAS - Brachycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndrome)
- **Overheating:** Difficulty regulating body temperature
- **Hip dysplasia:** Joint development problems
- **Allergies and skin issues:** Especially in facial folds
- **Eye problems:** Various genetic eye conditions
- **Spinal issues:** Including intervertebral disc disease

This is why we conduct extensive health testing on all our breeding dogs and offer strong health guarantees.
