title: Can I visit and meet the puppies if I'm in Boston?

Absolutely. We have family homes in both New York City and Chicago — you're welcome to visit whichever location your puppy is at. From Boston, NYC is just a quick shuttle flight or about a 4-hour drive. If you can't make the trip, we're happy to FaceTime or video call so you can see your puppy before committing. We never pressure anyone into a decision — we want you to feel 100% confident.
