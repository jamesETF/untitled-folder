title: Why are French Bulldogs so expensive?
categories: [ethicalfrenchie]
---

French Bulldog pricing reflects several factors:
- Most French Bulldogs require cesarean section deliveries due to their large heads
- Small litter sizes (typically 2-4 puppies)
- Extensive health testing required for breeding dogs ($5,000-$50,000+ investment per quality breeding female)
- High demand and popularity - they're currently the most popular breed in the U.S.
- Specialized breeding knowledge and higher veterinary costs
- Individual hand-raising and socialization
