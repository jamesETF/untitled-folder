title: Are French Bulldogs good for LA apartment living?
categories: [lafaq]

Frenchies are perfect for LA apartment life — they're small, low-energy indoors, and won't annoy your neighbors with barking. The one thing to watch in LA is the heat. French Bulldogs are brachycephalic (flat-faced), which makes them sensitive to high temperatures. Keep walks to early morning or evening during summer months, always have water available, and make sure your apartment has AC. Other than that, they're ideal city dogs — happy to ride along on errands, hang at an outdoor cafe, or just chill at home.
