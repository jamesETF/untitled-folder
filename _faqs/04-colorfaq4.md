**Standard AKC colors** include fawn, cream, brindle, pied, and white — these are recognized for AKC show competitions and are the most common. **Rare/exotic colors** include [blue](/puppies/upcoming-colors/blue-french-bulldog), [lilac](/puppies/upcoming-colors/lilac-french-bulldog), [merle](/puppies/upcoming-colors/merle-french-bulldog), isabella, and [fluffy](/puppies/upcoming-colors/fluffy-french-bulldog) (long-haired). Rare colors are produced by specific gene combinations (like the dilute gene dd for blue, or the Lh gene for fluffy coats). They're not AKC show-eligible but can be AKC registered as pets. The rarity and additional breeding complexity is what drives higher pricing.
