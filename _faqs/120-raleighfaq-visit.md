title: Can I visit and meet the puppies if I'm in Raleigh?

Absolutely. We have family homes in both New York City and Chicago — you're welcome to visit whichever location your puppy is at. From Raleigh, NYC is about a 1.5-hour direct flight from RDU. If you can't make the trip, we're happy to FaceTime or video call so you can meet your puppy and see the parents before making a decision. We never want you to feel like you're buying sight unseen.
