French Bulldogs typically live 10–12 years, with some living even longer with proper care. The biggest factors in lifespan are genetics (which is why health testing matters so much), diet, regular veterinary checkups, weight management, and attention to their brachycephalic-specific needs like heat sensitivity and breathing. Ethically bred Frenchies from health-tested parents tend to have fewer chronic issues and longer, healthier lives.
