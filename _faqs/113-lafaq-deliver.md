title: Do you deliver French Bulldog puppies to Los Angeles?
categories: [lafaq]

Yes — we deliver to Los Angeles and all of Southern California. Your puppy flies in-cabin with a trusted flight nanny directly into LAX from either our NYC or Chicago location. The nanny meets you at the airport and personally hands off your puppy, and your puppy is cared for the entire way. We've delivered to families across LA, Orange County, San Diego, and beyond.
