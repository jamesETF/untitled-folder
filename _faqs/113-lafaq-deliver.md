title: Do you deliver French Bulldog puppies to Los Angeles?
categories: [lafaq]

Yes — we personally deliver to Los Angeles and all of Southern California. Your puppy flies in-cabin with us directly into LAX from either our NYC or Chicago location. We meet you at the airport and hand you your puppy ourselves — the same person you've been FaceTiming with through the whole process. We've delivered to families across LA, Orange County, San Diego, and beyond. [Learn more about delivery](/puppy-delivery/).
