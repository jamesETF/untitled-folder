title: Blue vs lilac French Bulldog — what's the difference?
categories: [bluefaq]

Blue Frenchies carry two copies of the dilution gene (dd) and have a dark gray coat, while lilacs carry both the dilution gene and the chocolate gene (bb/dd) which lightens the coat into a silvery, purple-toned color. The lilac is noticeably lighter than the blue and has that distinctive purple hue on the nose, ears and paw pads. Once you see them side by side it is pretty easy to tell them apart.
