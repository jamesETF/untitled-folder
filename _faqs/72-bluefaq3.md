title: How much do Blue French Bulldogs cost?
categories: [bluefaq]
---
Blue French Bulldogs from a reputable, health-testing breeder typically cost $4,500–$6,500. The higher price compared to standard colors reflects the rarity of the dilute gene, additional genetic testing required, and smaller breeding pools. If you see a blue Frenchie advertised for under $2,000, it's almost certainly a scam or a puppy mill with no health testing. Our blue Frenchies come with full genetic testing documentation, AKC registration, a health guarantee, and lifetime breeder support. [View available puppies](/french-bulldog-puppies/).
