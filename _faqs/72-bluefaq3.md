Blue French Bulldogs can be AKC registered, but like lilacs they are considered an exotic color and do not fall under the AKC's approved breed standard colors. This means they can be registered as a French Bulldog but would not be eligible to compete in AKC conformation shows. For most families this doesn't matter at all — they're looking for a companion, not a show dog.
