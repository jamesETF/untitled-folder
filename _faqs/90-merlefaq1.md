A merle French Bulldog has a unique mottled coat where areas of color are randomly diluted against a darker base, creating a pattern that is completely one of a kind on every dog. The pattern comes from the M-locus gene and can appear across many color combinations including blue merle, lilac merle, and chocolate merle.
