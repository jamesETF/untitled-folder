Merle French Bulldogs from reputable, health-testing breeders typically cost $5,000–$6,500+. The merle pattern is caused by the M-locus gene, which creates a unique mottled coat — no two merle Frenchies look exactly alike. The pricing reflects the rarity, the genetic testing required (especially to avoid double merle breeding), and the selective breeding involved. Always ask for DNA test results when purchasing a merle Frenchie. [View available puppies](/french-bulldog-puppies/).
