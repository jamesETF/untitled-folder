Yes, and we actually fly with every puppy personally as a flight nanny — your puppy travels in-cabin with us, never in cargo. We deliver nationwide, so no matter where you are located we can get your puppy to you safely and comfortably. It is a really seamless process and most puppies do great on the flight.
