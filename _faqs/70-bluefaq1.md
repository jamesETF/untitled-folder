title: Are Blue French Bulldogs healthy?

Yes — when bred responsibly with proper genetic testing. The blue color comes from the dilute gene (dd), which is not inherently linked to health problems. The issues arise when breeders skip health testing and breed purely for color. All of our blue Frenchie parents are tested for CMR1, DM, HUU, JHC, and color dilution alopecia (CDA). A health-tested blue Frenchie from a reputable breeder is just as healthy as any other color.
