categories: [fluffyfaq]
---
Fluffy Frenchies come in a wide range of colors. Here at Ethical Frenchie we have produced fluffy platinums, merles, blacks, blues, lilacs, lilac and tans, and blue and tans. The fluffy gene is completely independent from color genetics so it can appear in almost any color combination. Fluffy merles and fluffy lilacs tend to be the most popular with our buyers.
