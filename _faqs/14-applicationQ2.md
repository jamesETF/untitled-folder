title: Why do you require an application?
categories: [application, pricingfaq]

We've placed over 200 puppies with an almost 0% rehoming rate — and the application is a big part of why. It helps us understand your living situation, lifestyle, and expectations so we can make sure you and your puppy are set up for success. It's not invasive — it takes about 5 minutes and helps us match the right puppy to the right home.
