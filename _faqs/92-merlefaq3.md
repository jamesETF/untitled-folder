title: Are Merle French Bulldogs purebred?
categories: [merlefaq]

Yes. Modern merle French Bulldogs are 100% purebred French Bulldogs, verifiable through DNA testing. While the merle gene was originally introduced through outcrossing years ago, after multiple generations of backcrossing, today's merle Frenchies are genetically purebred. Reputable breeders can provide DNA panel results proving this. We DNA-test all of our breeding dogs and can provide full documentation for any puppy.
