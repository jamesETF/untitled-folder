title: Can I visit and meet the puppies before purchasing?
categories: [chicagofaq]

We start with a video call or FaceTime so you can meet your potential fur baby face-to-face. From there, we arrange a meet-and-greet. [View our current puppies](/french-bulldog-puppies/) or join the request list to be notified when new litters are available.
