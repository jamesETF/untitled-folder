title: Does color affect a French Bulldog's personality?
categories: [colorfaq]

No — a French Bulldog's color or coat pattern has zero bearing on its personality. Temperament is shaped by genetics (from the parents), socialization, and the environment the puppy is raised in. A blue Frenchie, a merle Frenchie, and a standard fawn Frenchie raised the same way will have the same loving temperament. That's why we focus on socialization and matching each puppy with the right family, regardless of color.
