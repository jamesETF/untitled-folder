title: Can I visit and meet the puppies if I'm in LA?

We'd love that! We have family homes in both New York City and Chicago, so depending on where your puppy is, it would mean a trip to one of those locations. Many of our LA families choose to fly in for the day to meet their puppy — and take them home the same trip. If visiting isn't practical, we do FaceTime and video calls so you can see your puppy and their parents before making a commitment. Transparency is everything to us.
