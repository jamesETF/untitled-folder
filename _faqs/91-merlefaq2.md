title: Can Merle French Bulldogs be AKC registered?

Yes — Merle French Bulldogs can be AKC registered as pets. However, the merle pattern is not accepted for AKC conformation shows and competitions. This doesn't affect the dog's registration, health, or value as a family companion. Your merle Frenchie will receive full AKC registration papers and can participate in AKC events like agility, obedience, and rally — just not breed conformation shows.
