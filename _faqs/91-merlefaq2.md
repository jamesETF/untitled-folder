title: Are merle French Bulldogs purebred?
categories: [merlefaq]

This is a topic with some honest debate in the French Bulldog community, and we believe in being upfront about it. Merle is not a traditionally occurring pattern in French Bulldogs the way it is in other breeds, which is why responsible breeding and DNA testing are so important with this color. Merle French Bulldogs are completely purebred on DNA.
