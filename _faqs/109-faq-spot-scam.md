title: How do I spot a French Bulldog scam?
categories: [faqpage-scams]

French Bulldog scams are everywhere — here are the biggest red flags:
- **Price too low** — If someone is selling a Frenchie puppy for $500–$1,000, it's almost certainly a scam. Ethical breeding costs far more than that.
- **Won't FaceTime or video call** — A real breeder will happily show you the puppy and parents on video. If they refuse, walk away.
- **Payment by gift cards, Zelle, or wire transfer only** — Scammers avoid traceable payment methods.
- **No health testing documentation** — Ask for specific genetic test results (CMR1, DM, HUU, JHC). Vague answers = no tests done.
- **Puppies always available in every color** — Real breeders have waitlists and limited availability.
- **No physical location** — They can't tell you where the puppies are raised or let you visit.

If something feels off, trust your gut. We're always happy to help you evaluate another breeder — just [reach out](/contact-us/).
