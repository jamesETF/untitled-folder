title: What is a double merle and why is it dangerous?

A double merle happens when both parents carry the merle gene and a puppy inherits two copies — this can result in serious health issues including deafness, blindness, and severe eye abnormalities. At Ethical Frenchie we have a strict no merle-to-merle breeding policy, no exceptions.
