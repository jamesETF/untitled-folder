Our process is straightforward:
1. **Browse** our [available puppies](/french-bulldog-puppies/) and find one that catches your eye
2. **Apply** — fill out our [quick application](/application/) so we can learn about your family and lifestyle
3. **Deposit** — once approved, a deposit secures your puppy
4. **Updates** — we send you photos, videos, and health updates as your puppy grows
5. **Delivery or Pickup** — when your puppy is ready (typically 10–12 weeks old), we arrange local pickup in NYC or Chicago, or we personally deliver your puppy nationwide

The whole process from application to bringing your puppy home is typically 2–8 weeks depending on availability. We're available by phone, text, or email throughout.
