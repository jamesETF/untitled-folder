title: Are Lilac French Bulldogs healthy?
categories: [lilacfaq]

Yes — when bred by a reputable breeder who does proper genetic testing. The lilac color itself doesn't cause health problems. Issues arise when breeders chase the color without testing for genetic conditions. Our lilac Frenchie parents are fully tested for CMR1, DM, HUU, JHC, and color dilution alopecia. A health-tested lilac Frenchie has the same health expectations as any standard-color Frenchie. We provide full health documentation and a health guarantee with every puppy.
