title: Are French Bulldogs good for Boston apartment living?
categories: [bostonfaq]
---

French Bulldogs are one of the best breeds for Boston apartment life. They're compact (20–28 lbs), rarely bark, and don't need a yard — a few walks around the Common or along the Esplanade is plenty. They handle smaller living spaces perfectly because they'd rather be on the couch next to you than running laps. Just keep in mind that Boston winters can be tough on Frenchies — their short coats mean they need a jacket when temps drop, and summer humidity requires extra caution since they're sensitive to heat.
