title: Do French Bulldogs have separation anxiety?
categories: [faqpage-breed]

French Bulldogs were bred to be companion dogs, so they do form very strong bonds with their owners. Some Frenchies can develop separation anxiety if left alone for extended periods — typically more than 6–8 hours regularly. The good news is that proper socialization from puppyhood (which we prioritize) makes a big difference. Crate training, gradual alone-time practice, and keeping a consistent routine all help. Most well-adjusted Frenchies handle normal work schedules just fine, especially if they have a companion or enrichment toys.
