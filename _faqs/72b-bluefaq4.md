title: Do blue French Bulldogs have more health problems?
categories: [bluefaq]

Blue Frenchies are not predisposed to any additional health conditions as a result of their coat color. They experience the same sensitivities as any other Frenchie. They can have slightly more sensitive skin and may react to fragranced products, so we recommend keeping grooming and bedding products fragrance-free.
