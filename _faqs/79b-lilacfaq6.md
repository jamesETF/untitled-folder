title: What is the difference between lilac and blue French Bulldogs?
categories: [lilacfaq]

The main difference is in their genetics and coat color. Blue Frenchies carry two copies of the dilution gene (dd) and have a dark gray coat. Lilacs carry both the dilution gene and the chocolate gene (bb/dd) and have a light silver coat with purple undertones.
