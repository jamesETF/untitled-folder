title: What's the difference between a French Bulldog and a Boston Terrier?
categories: [faqpage-colors]

They look similar but are very different dogs. French Bulldogs are stockier (20–28 lbs vs 12–25 lbs for Bostons), calmer, and more laid-back — they're happy to lounge on the couch all day. Boston Terriers are leaner, more energetic, and need more exercise. Frenchies have signature bat ears and a wider, more muscular build, while Bostons have a tuxedo-like coat pattern and pointier ears. Health-wise, both are brachycephalic, but Frenchies tend to have more breathing-related concerns. Temperament-wise, Frenchies are the ultimate lap dogs — they want to be glued to you. If you want a calm, affectionate companion for city living, a Frenchie is the better fit.
