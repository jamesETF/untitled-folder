title: How much do your French Bulldog puppies cost?
categories: [ethicalfrenchie]
---

Our French bulldog prices are at "fair market rate." We constantly scan the internet and other breeders to ensure appropriate pricing. Blue and Merle Frenchies are usually priced higher than standard colors. French Bulldogs typically cost between $2,400-$5,500 depending on location, breeder, color, and age. The higher cost reflects the extensive breeding challenges, health testing, and individualized care each puppy receives.
