Our French Bulldog puppies are priced between $3,500–$6,500 depending on color, gender, and lineage. [Blue](/puppies/upcoming-colors/blue-french-bulldog), [Merle](/puppies/upcoming-colors/merle-french-bulldog), [Lilac](/puppies/upcoming-colors/lilac-french-bulldog), and [Fluffy](/puppies/upcoming-colors/fluffy-french-bulldog) Frenchies are typically at the higher end due to the rarity and additional genetic testing required. Standard colors start at the lower end of that range. The cost reflects what it actually takes to breed ethically: artificial insemination, C-section deliveries, extensive health testing ($5,000–$50,000+ per breeding female), small litter sizes (2–4 puppies), and individualized hand-raising. We also offer [financing options](/pricing/) to make it more accessible. [View our available puppies](/french-bulldog-puppies/).
