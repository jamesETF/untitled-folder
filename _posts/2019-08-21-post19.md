## Want to boost your French Bulldog's meals and make them more nutritious? Keep on reading.

The supplements below can be a great addition to any dog diet, either raw, fresh or kibble based. 

BUT you definitely want to make sure that supplementation is included if you are feeding a dry dog food.  Dry dog foods often lack nutrients due to the intense food processing approach. Dry dog food is at the bottom of the "food chart", no matter how "high end" or "naturally sourced" the ingredients are. 

## [Dr. Harvey's Raw Vibrance](https://amzn.to/31CiZb3)

Great supplement for a homemade raw or cooked diet, but also a very beneficial additive to kibble. It's basically a blend of different nutrients your dog's body needs to maintain normal body functions. Ingredients are organic and NON-GMO.

## [2. Super Snouts Super Shrooms Immunity Supplement](https://amzn.to/3b6rLRR)

**Super Shrooms Support** a healthy inflammatory response and detoxification process in the body. Super Shrooms contain bioactive compounds that have the ability to neutralize toxins, promote protective enzymes and decrease oxidative stress, which is responsible for accelerated aging of the body.

## 3. Fatty Acids

Again not all sources of fatty acids are equally easy to absorb, but you still want to make sure that the fatty acids requirements are covered. 

Salmon oil is not a great source dog owners should be relying on. Not only is it high in mercury but it also goes rancid quickly. Everything you buy oil supplements you have to make sure they are cold-pressed and refrigirated. 

There are 4 different types of fatty acids that your dog needs to thrive:

1. **Linoleic Acid (LA)**

Some good sources or LA are chicken fat, chicken skin, hemp seeds, coconut oil, hemp seed oil, etc..

* [Cold pressed coconut oil ](https://amzn.to/2QyfTyz)

2. **Alpha-Linolenic Acid (ALA)**

**Best sources of ALA would be flex seeds, chia seeds, hemp seeds, or oils made from these ingredients. **

* [Cold pressed hemp seed oil](https://amzn.to/32vJRsq)
* [Cold pressed flax seed oil](https://amzn.to/2QBBLJo)

3. **Arachidonic Acid (AA)**

Dogs can convert Linoleic Acid to AA, however puppies cannot. That only applies to adult dogs. Some food sources of AA are raw eggs, raw beef, raw chicken. So make sure you include it in your growing puppy's diet, to obtain the required amount of Omega 6 fatty acids.

4. **Eicosapentaenoic & Docosahexaenoic Acid (EPA/DHA)**

**This omega 3 fatty acid can be found in marine life. But where does the marine life get it from? PLANKTON! **

**Phytoplankton is one of the best and most easily absorbed sources of EPA/DHA. **

* [**Phytoplankton Supplement for dogs**](https://amzn.to/3hKBAaE)

Other good sources of EPHA/DHA are sardines, salmon, herring, etc..

**Rotate the ingredients to achieve balance, no need to give every fatty acid every day. **

## [4. Guts and Glory Dehydrated Organs and Glands](https://fourleafrover.com/products/guts-glory)

![Image of Guts and Glory Organ supplement](/gut-and-glory-supplement-small.jpg)

This is an amazing blend of organs and glands that is so beneficial to raw feeders but should also be a part of a cooked or kibble based diet. Those of you who raw feed know how hard it is to find organs that aren't liver or kidneys. 

This blend has it all, from brains to heart, spleen and more. It sourced from free range farms and hormone and pesticide free. 

## [5. Dr. Harvey's Multivitamin and Mineral Supplement ](https://amzn.to/31DYSJn)

![null]()

Not all multivitamins are created equal, remember that when shopping for a multivitamin for your doggo or yourself. Look for supplements that are holistic and don't rely on synthetic ingredients.

This Dr. Harvey's Multivitamin formula is made from real ingredients. So if you want to keep it simple and have a supplement that is all in one, then i would definitely put this one at the top of the list. 

## 6. Raw Goat + Probiotics and Enzymes

![Image of raw goat milk bottles](/raw-goat-milk-dog.jpeg)

Goat milk contains vitamins, minerals, electrolytes, trace elements, enzymes, protein, and fatty acids. In fact, the body can digest goat’s milk in 20 minutes. Goats Milk is more digestible than cow’s milk and lacks the complex proteins that are often associated with allergies. Having fat molecules one-fifth the size of those in cow’s milk makes it easily digestible and tolerable even for dogs with digestive issues.

* Great for digestion - for those pups who have sensitive tummies!
* Lessens mucous and inflammation - Perfect for dogs who suffer from allergies!
* Super Immune booster - large amounts of vitamins and dog's health is enhanced!

## [7. Solid Gold Bone Broth ](https://amzn.to/3b3Hukw)

![Image of bone broth for dogs](/image-of-solid-gold-bone-broth.jpg)

In the process of making bone broth, collagen and cartilage are boiled down, releasing anti-inflammatory nutrients like chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine, and other compounds that help joints stay strong. 

Additionally, bone broth contains amino acids like glycine, proline, and arginine that all have whole-body anti-inflammatory effects. Finally, the abundance of collagen in bone broth helps structure and strengthen bones. ** Some of the benefits of bone broth are:**

* Joint rejuvenation 
* Healthy gut 
* Digestion support 
* Enhanced hydration 
* Skin & coat health 
* Increased appetite (due to a healthy, optimally-functioning gut)
