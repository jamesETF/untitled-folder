As soon as the air turns crisp and the leaves start to fall, our Frenchies feel it too. Cooler temps and dry indoor heat can leave their skin flaky, their paws cracked, and their immune system working overtime. To make the transition smooth, here's our go-to lineup for fall — from balms and supplements to cozy must-haves that keep your pup feeling (and looking) their best.

## Deep Moisture for Noses and Paws

If you've ever noticed your Frenchie's nose getting rough or their paws a little cracked this time of year, it's not just you. The shift in humidity and temperature can dry them out fast.

**Favorites we love:**

- **[Natural Dog Company Paw Soother](https://amzn.to/3Kdckx3)** – a rich, all-natural balm that sinks in quickly and doesn't leave greasy prints on your floor.
- **[Snout Soother by The Blissful Dog](https://amzn.to/3XbFsI2)** – gentle enough for sensitive skin and lick-safe.
- **DIY Tip:** You can make your own version with unrefined shea butter, coconut oil, and a drop of vitamin E.

Use it after evening walks or before bed so it has time to absorb overnight.

## Skin Supplements That Actually Work

Fall can be tough on your Frenchie's coat and skin — especially with heaters drying out the air. A good internal support routine makes all the difference.

**Look for supplements with:**

- **[Omega-3s](https://amzn.to/43IzhyG)** (from fish or algae oil) for soft skin and a glossy coat.
- **Zinc + Biotin** for skin repair and shedding control. A great option would be the **[Dog Is Human daily chew](https://dogishuman.com/products/multivitamin?)**.
- **[Canine Immune Support](https://amzn.to/43LB06q)** to help keep their immune system strong through seasonal changes.

**Our personal go-to combo:** Salmon oil + turkey tail mushroom powder. It's a simple daily habit that supports both skin and gut health.

## Keep Bath Time Gentle

When it's cooler out, Frenchies don't need as many baths — every three to four weeks is plenty. But what you wash with matters. Skip anything heavily scented or drying.

**Our top picks:**

- **[Earthbath Oatmeal & Aloe Shampoo](https://amzn.to/44oPJnU)** – unscented and soothing.
- **[Vet's Best Hypo-Allergenic Shampoo](https://amzn.to/3XJanLS)** – great for Frenchies with allergies or sensitive skin.

Follow up with a light conditioner or spritz of coconut-based coat mist to lock in moisture.

## Fall Foods and Immunity Boosts

As the weather shifts, your dog's immune system can use a little backup. A few smart additions to their diet go a long way.

**Try:**

- **[Probiotic chews](https://amzn.to/4ieYner)** with Lactobacillus acidophilus for digestion and immunity.
- **[Colostrum powder](https://amzn.to/48a4f3Z)** for allergy support. Do not use if your dog is allergic to beef.
- **[Pumpkin treats](https://amzn.to/3XJaxms)** — because it's fall, obviously, and also great for digestion.

## Cozy Layers and Fall Accessories

Frenchies aren't built for cold weather, so a light layer or two is non-negotiable once the temperature drops.

**Our autumn staples include:**

- A [soft fleece hoodie](https://amzn.to/3K8SzXi) for everyday walks.
- A [light puffer vest](https://amzn.to/44rotVV) for breezy mornings.
- A [warm throw blanket or heated mat](https://amzn.to/4rjJfRm) for post-walk naps.

Choose breathable materials that won't cause overheating indoors. If you're worried about temperature regulation, our guide on [keeping your Frenchie cool during heat waves](https://ethicalfrenchie.com/blog/keeping-your-french-bulldog-cool-during-a-heat-wave-tips-to-avoid-heat-stroke/) has useful tips that apply year-round.

## Hydration and Air Quality

Dry indoor air = dry skin. If you notice dandruff or dullness, it might be time to tweak your setup.

**Simple fixes:**

- Run a [humidifier](https://amzn.to/4icbkFT) in the main room.
- Encourage drinking with a [filtered water fountain](https://amzn.to/4a6OGNa).
- Mix in a little [bone broth](https://amzn.to/3JO8nPl) to meals for extra hydration and minerals.

## Final Thoughts

Transitioning your Frenchie from summer to fall isn't about overhauling their routine — it's about small adjustments that keep their skin hydrated, their immune system supported, and their mood happy.

A few high-quality products, consistent supplements, and cozy vibes can make all the difference.
