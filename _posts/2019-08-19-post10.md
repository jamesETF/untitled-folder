Frenchies are among the most favorite pets of worldwide households because of their lovable companionship. Therefore, no wonder you want to spare the best food for your furry friends.

However, not all brands of commercial dog food on the market are healthy enough for their digestive system. It depends on which ingredients are mixed. Understanding pet food labels is also an excellent way to take better care of your Frenchie.

So, let’s sort out the essential **nutrients for French bulldogs** you should always keep in mind.

## Vital nutrients for French Bulldogs

### Protein

Studies show that protein can bring about numerous benefits to bodies upon consumption. It supplies protein subunits or amino acids to build nails, skin, tendons, ligaments, muscles, and cartilage. Besides, protein is one of the essential substances for the production of hormones. Protein for Frenchies is rich in fish, poultry, meat, and some plant ingredients, including soybean 

_**How about protein in plants?**_

Soybean meal is known as a by-product created during the production of soybean oil. For that reason, not many labels welcome soy products.

Meat used in Frenchie food should be the clean flesh of slaughtered lamb, turkey, chicken, or cattle.

Sometimes, there are striated skeletal muscle, diaphragm, esophagus, tongue, and heart attached in that flesh. Hair, horns, hooves, teeth, and feathers will get completely removed so as not to mix with the fresh meat.

Though high protein dog food is necessary for your French pup, such diets would be detrimental to sick dogs’ health. In this case, make sure to go for low protein dog food to help relieve symptoms and push up the recovery process.

### Carbohydrates

Plants and grains are two primary sources that supply carbohydrates for your Frenchies.

Carbohydrates, known to provide bulk and energy, are in two categories, including fibers and starches, or sugars.

Fibers are products of fermentation that produce short-chain fatty acids thanks to bacteria in dog intestines. Large amounts of such acids can come from highly fermentable fiber sources like vegetable gums. While moderately fermentable fibers (available in beet pulp, etc.) supply both acids and bulk for moving waste via digestive tracts, slightly fermentable fibers mainly provide bulk and only a limited number of fatty acids.

Comprised starches are of many different types of sugar (including fructose and glucose), which can get easily converted into usable energy through dogs’ digestive mechanism.

### Vitamins and minerals

In the list of the **best nutrients for French bulldogs**, the enormous benefits of vitamins can be by no means neglected. They enhance blood clotting, bone growth, produce energy, and prevent oxidation. To facilitate the absorption of vitamin C into the body, water is required, whereas, vitamins A, D, E, and K ask for the provision of fat.

Minerals are helpful in muscle contractions and nerve transmissions besides providing support for the development of skeletons. Phosphorous, a vital mineral for senior dogs’ cellular repair and puppies’ growth, can be seen on many dog food labels.

### Fat

Fats are another necessary substance for dogs to take in through eating food. Once digested, they can provide bodies with necessary fat subunits, omega-3, and omega-6 fatty acids.

Numerous studies have indicated that omega-3 fatty acids play a crucial role in decreasing inflammation and blood clotting while omega-6 fatty acids serve to maintain proper membrane structure as well as enhance Frenchie’s coat and skin. Fats are the primary source of stored energy found in the body, which can provide a two-fold amount of energy compared to proteins or carbohydrates.

Fats are abundant in fish, poultry, meat and plant oils, namely flax and vegetable oils, so such kinds of food are in many vets’ recommendations for dog diets.
