## What Is a Blue French Bulldog?

A blue French Bulldog has a deep, dark gray coat that some people call blue and some call gray — it really does depend on the lighting. In natural sunlight it can look almost silver; indoors it might seem more like a dark charcoal gray. Either way, it's a really beautiful color.

The blue coat comes from two copies of the dilution gene (dd), which lightens the black pigment into that blue/gray shade. Their nose and paw pads will also have a grayish/blue tone, which is one of the ways you can visually identify a true blue Frenchie.

As puppies, blue Frenchies often have blue or gray eyes that will shift to a lighter green or yellow as they get older, similar to lilacs. Most buyers who see one for the first time are surprised by how unique the color is in person. The blue Frenchie coat is still one of the most popular and sought-after colors in the breed.

## Are Blue French Bulldogs Healthy? An Honest Answer

Blue French Bulldogs are generally healthy dogs, but like all Frenchies they do require some extra attention when it comes to their skin. One thing we have noticed with blue and lilac Frenchies specifically is that they tend to have more sensitive skin compared to standard-colored Frenchies. They can react to things like perfume, fragranced detergents, or scented grooming products, so we always recommend keeping things simple and fragrance-free when it comes to anything that touches their coat or bedding.

You will see a lot online about Color Dilution Alopecia in blue dogs, but true CDA is actually rare in French Bulldogs. Any hair or skin issues blues experience are much more commonly tied to food allergies, environmental sensitivities, or seasonal changes — not their coat color itself.

Outside of skin sensitivity, a blue Frenchie from health-tested parents is just as healthy as any other color. French Bulldogs as a breed do have their quirks — they are brachycephalic, meaning their flat face can sometimes cause breathing sensitivities, and they don't do well in extreme heat. That is true across all colors, not just blues.

## Blue French Bulldog Price in 2026

Our blue French Bulldog puppies are priced between **$4,000 and $5,000**. We price each puppy individually based on our expertise — things like coat, markings, and overall quality. Gender does not affect the price; males and females are priced the same.

## How We Breed Blue French Bulldogs Responsibly

When it comes to selecting our blue breeding pairs, health always comes first. We DNA test all of our breeding dogs through [Embark](https://embarkvet.com), and if the results are concerning in any way, that dog is removed from our breeding program. A beautiful blue Frenchie coat means nothing to us if the health doesn't meet our expectations.

We also take buyer feedback seriously. If a family reports an issue with one of our puppies that went undetected, we take that into account and will remove a dog from our breeding pool based on that information too. We think that's just the responsible thing to do, and it's the only way to actually improve your program over time.

## Blue Frenchie Temperament and Care

Blue Frenchies have the exact same temperament as any other French Bulldog — loving, goofy, and occasionally stubborn. We get this question sometimes from buyers who are a little uncertain, but the blue color has been established in the breed for decades now, so there are no personality differences tied to the color. It is purely cosmetic.

Blue French Bulldogs are just a really easy breed to love. They do well in apartments, they're great with kids and families, and they're a good fit for first-time dog owners.

## Why Choose Ethical Frenchie for Your Blue Frenchie

Buying a blue French Bulldog from Ethical Frenchie is never just a transaction. Once you get a puppy from us, you become part of our community and we stay in touch long after your puppy goes home.

We have been breeding and placing French Bulldogs since 2017 and have successfully placed over 200 puppies across both our New York City and Chicago locations. We are proud of our almost 0% rehoming rate — to us that means we are not just placing puppies, we are placing them in the right homes.

We take the time to educate every buyer before their puppy comes home, so you feel prepared and confident from day one. And when it's time for delivery, your puppy flies in-cabin with us as a flight nanny, never in cargo. We want the experience to feel easy and exciting from start to finish, because bringing home a new puppy should be one of the best days of your life.
