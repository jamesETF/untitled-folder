## What Is a Lilac French Bulldog?

The lilac French Bulldog is a light silver, diluted variation of a blue/gray Frenchie. Their eyes are a lighter green color, and their ears, nose and paw pads have a purple hue due to the presence of both the blue (d) and chocolate (b) gene. Their eyes shine red under video flash, and that is one of the ways to confirm a Frenchie is a lilac outside of actual Embark DNA testing.

We vividly remember seeing a lilac Frenchie for the first time back in 2016 and being in disbelief that the color is actually real. It was a true rarity running across one back in the day. There is something almost magical about the soft silver coat with purple undertones, and photos never do them justice.

Now, almost a decade and many happy lilac French Bulldogs later, we are trained enough to recognize the color from afar — no video flash or testing needed to determine the genetics behind it.

## How Ethical Frenchie Breeds Healthy Lilac Puppies

As a lilac French Bulldog breeder with years of experience, we primarily focus on health and temperament, the coat color being secondary. To successfully produce a lilac Frenchie puppy that is both healthy and lovable, we start with health screening the parents for the common breed-related conditions using companies such as [Embark](https://embarkvet.com) and Animal Genetics. Once we confirm both parents are clear and both carry the proper genes to produce lilac puppies, we carefully pair them together.

To Ethical Frenchie, temperament matters just as much as health. A beautiful dog that is not friendly or well-adjusted isn't a dog we're proud to send home. There is intent behind every pairing — health first, temperament second, color third.

## Lilac French Bulldog Price — What to Expect in 2026

Our lilac French Bulldog puppies are priced between **$4,500 and $5,000** and come with lifetime breeder support, health guarantee, microchipping, up-to-date age-appropriate vaccinations and deworming, tick and flea prevention, heartworm prevention, and AKC registration if purchased with breeding rights.

Realistic pricing for an ethically bred lilac French Bulldog in 2026 can vary. Most fall in the $4,000–$5,000 range, with some breeders still charging up to $10,000 for unique and extensively tested bloodlines.

On the other end of the spectrum, we recommend avoiding suspiciously low-priced lilac puppies. It often results in a scam and heartbreak for the family, and can sometimes indicate an inferior-quality bloodline and health concerns. If the lilac French Bulldog price seems too good to be true, it usually is.

## Lilac vs. Blue vs. Isabella — What's the Difference?

The difference between lilac, blue, and Isabella French Bulldogs is very obvious when you know what to look for, but sometimes confusing for buyers who aren't familiar with color genetics.

- **Blue French Bulldogs** are dark gray and carry two copies of the blue gene (d)
- **Lilac** coats are much lighter compared to blue, due to the combination of both the blue (d) and chocolate (b) genes
- **Isabella Frenchies**, sometimes also called Champagne Lilac, are a mix of the blue (d) and testable cocoa gene — they have a gorgeous silver coat with an orange undertone

The simplest way we explain it to buyers: think of blue as the base, lilac as blue plus chocolate, and Isabella as blue plus cocoa. Each combination shifts the coat color just enough to create something different and unique. Once you've seen all three in person, you'll never mix them up again.

## Lilac French Bulldog Health — What Every Buyer Should Know

Color dilution alopecia (CDA) is a condition sometimes associated with the blue (d) gene. However, this mostly affects the Doberman breed and is not that common in lilac French Bulldogs. French Bulldogs can suffer from seasonal alopecia that is not tied to just one coat color and can affect them across the board.

The French Bulldog breed is prone to skin sensitivities that can in most cases be easy to manage, and Ethical Frenchie educates you on proper management tools so you can keep your lilac Frenchie happy and healthy.

## Why Families Choose Ethical Frenchie for Their Lilac

Buying a lilac French Bulldog from Ethical Frenchie is never transactional. Once you get a puppy from us, you become part of our community. We have been carefully breeding lilac Frenchies since 2017 and successfully placed over 200 pups over the years, with an almost 0% rehoming rate. That number means a lot to us — it tells us that we're not just placing puppies, we're placing them in the right homes.

We take the time to educate every buyer on how to properly care for their new addition, which goes a long way in preventing the training struggles, health surprises, and overwhelm that can sometimes lead to rehoming. We want you to feel confident and prepared from day one.

Every puppy we place is either picked up locally or hand-delivered by a member of our team. If the delivery includes flying, the puppy flies in cabin — never cargo. Because how your puppy arrives matters just as much to us as how they were raised.

## How to Get Your Lilac French Bulldog Puppy

The purchase process for a lilac Frenchie will be a little different for every buyer, depending on your location, time frame, and any unique requirements — yes, we've helped coordinate surprise birthday puppies, Christmas deliveries, and even worked hand in hand with the Make-A-Wish Foundation for terminally ill children.

**Step 1:** Reach out through our [contact form](/contact-us/) or use the chat icon at the bottom of our page.

**Step 2:** After reviewing your application, we will contact you to get additional information about your family, and vice versa.

**Step 3:** Once you've picked your puppy and placed a deposit, the timeline varies. If the puppy is already 8 weeks old and ready to go, the whole process can move in as little as 2–3 business days. If you're placing a deposit on a newborn or a future litter, that timeline is more like 2–6 months.

We encourage you to [reach out and connect with Ethical Frenchie directly](/contact-us/). We will answer your questions in detail.
