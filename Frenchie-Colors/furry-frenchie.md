## What Is a Fluffy French Bulldog?

A fluffy French Bulldog — sometimes called a long haired French Bulldog — is exactly what it sounds like: a French Bulldog with a longer, softer coat. They are 100% purebred Frenchies, not a mix, not a different breed. The fluffy coat comes from a naturally occurring recessive gene called FGF5, and both parents need to carry it in order to produce fluffy puppies.

The first thing people notice is usually the ears and the chest — they have this gorgeous longer fur that frames their face and gives them a total teddy bear look. In person they are even more impressive than in photos, which is saying a lot because fluffy Frenchies photograph beautifully.

What surprises most buyers is that despite the longer coat, they are not a high-maintenance dog. They shed a little more than a standard Frenchie but nothing crazy, and a regular brush a few times a week keeps their coat looking great. Same personality, same compact little body, just with a lot more floof.

## Are Fluffy Frenchies Really Purebred?

Yes — fluffy French Bulldogs are 100% purebred, and this is probably the question we get asked the most. We completely understand why. When people first see a fluffy Frenchie they assume there must be another breed mixed in somewhere, but that is not the case at all.

The fluffy coat is caused by the FGF5 gene, a naturally occurring recessive gene that has always existed in the French Bulldog bloodline. Both parents need to carry the gene in order to produce fluffy puppies, which is part of what makes them less common than standard-coated Frenchies.

We confirm purebred status through [Embark](https://embarkvet.com) DNA testing, so there is never any guessing. Every fluffy French Bulldog puppy we place comes with documentation and can be AKC registered.

## Fluffy French Bulldog Price — Realistic 2026 Guide

Our fluffy French Bulldog puppies are typically priced between **$6,000 and $8,500**, which reflects how rare they actually are. Fluffies are less common than standard-coated Frenchies because both parents need to carry the FGF5 gene, so when we do have them available they tend to go quickly.

You will see fluffy French Bulldogs listed online anywhere from a few hundred dollars all the way up to $20,000 or even $30,000 in some cases. On the low end, that is a major red flag — a suspiciously cheap fluffy is almost always a scam or a dog with no health testing behind it. On the high end, we personally feel a lot of that pricing is exaggerated and takes advantage of the rarity factor. We believe in keeping our prices realistic and accessible without cutting corners on health or quality.

Every fluffy puppy we place comes with lifetime breeder support, a health guarantee, up-to-date vaccines, deworming, microchip, and AKC registration if sold with breeding rights.

## Fluffy Frenchie Health and Grooming

Fluffy Frenchie grooming is really not as intimidating as people think. They do require a bit more brushing than a standard Frenchie, especially around the ears and chest where the fur is longest, but it is nothing crazy. They don't shed excessively, and a few brushing sessions a week is honestly all it takes to keep their coat looking great. A regular trim around the ears every now and then doesn't hurt either.

Health-wise, the FGF5 gene that causes the fluffy coat has no impact on the dog's health. Fluffy French Bulldogs have the exact same health profile as a standard Frenchie — same sensitivities, same care requirements, same life expectancy. The coat is purely cosmetic.

## How Ethical Frenchie Produces Fluffy Puppies

To produce fluffy puppies, both parents need to carry the FGF5 gene — one or both can be fluffy themselves, or they can be carriers with a standard coat. We use DNA testing to identify carriers so we can plan our litters intentionally. Without testing, you are just guessing, and that is not how we operate.

Even if the coat genetics are perfect, we will not move forward with a pairing if the health testing raises any concerns. That is non-negotiable for us. We have passed on some really beautiful fluffy pairings because something in the health results didn't sit right, and we stand by those decisions. The coat is never worth compromising the health of the litter.

Because fluffy Frenchies require both parents to carry the gene, they are naturally less common than standard-coated puppies. We don't always have fluffy French Bulldog puppies available, but when we do they are well-bred, health-tested, and come with everything we offer across all of our puppies. If you're interested in a fluffy, we always recommend [reaching out early](/contact-us/) so we can keep you in mind for upcoming litters.

## Fluffy French Bulldog Colors Available

Fluffy French Bulldogs come in a wide range of colors because the FGF5 gene is completely independent from color genetics. We have produced fluffy platinums, fluffy merles, fluffy blacks, fluffy blues, fluffy lilacs, fluffy lilac and tans, and fluffy blue and tans. Each combination is stunning in its own way, but there is something really special about seeing a rare color like a [lilac](/puppies/upcoming-colors/lilac-french-bulldog) or [merle](/puppies/upcoming-colors/merle-french-bulldog) with that fluffy coat — it takes an already beautiful dog to a whole other level.

The fluffy merles and fluffy lilacs tend to get the most attention from buyers, but honestly every fluffy color we have produced has found a home quickly. If you have a specific color combination in mind, reach out early — fluffy litters are rare and they don't last long.
